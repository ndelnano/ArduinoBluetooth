# ArduinoBluetooth

This project is an arduino script that receives input over a bluetooth connection to control an Adafruit Motor Shield V2 that is connected to four bidirectional DC motors. I used this project along with another of my repositories, BluetoothAndroidControlerAdafruitV2, to receive input via bluetooth from an android app controller.
